# Release Notes - Phase 3 Completion

## Overview

Completed Phase 3 (Inventory, Transactions, Offline Sync & Transactional endpoints) for Farmers Boot.

## Changes

### Inventory CRUD APIs
- Created comprehensive REST APIs for inventory management:
  - `GET/POST /api/inventory/items` - List and create inventory items
  - `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/inventory/items/[id]` - Individual item operations
  - `GET/POST /api/inventory/transactions` - Transaction history and manual adjustments
  - `GET/POST /api/inventory/low-stock` - Low-stock alerts and automatic procurement task creation
- All APIs include proper authentication, authorization, and RLS enforcement.

### Enhanced Transactional Operations
- Extended `apply_treatment` Postgres function to automatically create finance entries for veterinary expenses
- Maintained existing idempotency and inventory validation features
- Added finance integration for expense tracking on treatments

### Offline Queue with Conflict Resolution
- Enhanced `useOfflineQueue` hook to support inventory operations:
  - `create_inventory_item`, `update_inventory_item`, `delete_inventory_item`, `apply_treatment`
- Implemented conflict detection and resolution UI in QueuePage
- Added retry logic and comprehensive error handling
- Upgraded IndexedDB schema for better offline operation tracking

### Finance Integration
- Created finance APIs:
  - `GET/POST /api/finance/entries` - Finance entry CRUD
  - `GET /api/finance/reports/[type]` - Finance reports (summary)
- Automatic expense tracking for treatment applications
- Basic finance reporting with category and monthly breakdowns

### Frontend Components
