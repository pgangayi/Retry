# Release Notes - Phase 0 & 1 Completion

## Overview

Completed Phase 0 (repo setup & CI) and Phase 1 (core DB schema, migrations, and transactional API) for Farmers Boot.

## Changes

### Phase 0 - Repo & Infra Setup
- Added `.env.example` with placeholders for Supabase, Mapbox, Cloudflare.
- Enhanced CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with multi-job pipeline (root, frontend, backend, integration).
- Added `PHASE0.md` documenting setup steps.
- Configured root `package.json` with test scripts and dependencies (`pg`, `dotenv`, `@sentry/cloudflare`).

### Phase 1 - Core DB, Auth, RLS & Schema
- Created SQL migrations for PostGIS enablement, core tables (`farms`, `inventory_items`, `inventory_transactions`, `finance_entries`, `treatments`, `operations`), and RLS policies.
- Added PL/pgSQL function `apply_treatment` for transactional treatment application with idempotency.
- Implemented Cloudflare Pages Function wrapper with JWT validation, RPC calls to Supabase, error mapping, and Sentry logging.
- Added unit and integration tests for the handler.
- Migrated SQL files to `supabase/migrations/` for Supabase CLI compatibility.

### Documentation & Tooling
- Added `README.md` with setup, deployment, and API usage instructions.
- Created PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`).
- Updated migration README with Supabase CLI instructions.

## Deployment Notes

- Set env vars in Cloudflare Pages: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SENTRY_DSN`.
- Run migrations via Supabase CLI: `supabase db push`.
- API endpoint: `/api/operations/apply-treatment` (POST).

## Next Steps (Phase 2+)

- Implement frontend PWA with theme support and offline queue.
- Add more CRUD APIs and frontend integration.
- Wire events for automation (tasks, finance drafts).

## Testing

- Unit tests: mock DB, validate logic.
- Integration tests: real Postgres, verify transactions and idempotency.
- CI: runs both, plus migration validation.
